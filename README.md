## Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a critical aspect of understanding and optimizing customer relationships. This project explores the application of clustering algorithms to group customers based on key features, enabling businesses to tailor their strategies effectively.

---

## Objectives
Perform data-driven segmentation of customers.
Understand customer behaviors and preferences within each cluster.
Provide actionable recommendations for marketing and customer experience optimization.

---

## Approach
The project was executed in the following phases:

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
Loaded and examined the dataset.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Applied necessary transformations like scaling and encoding.

**Feature Selection and Engineering:**
Identified relevant features to enhance clustering performance.
Created new features as needed for better interpretability.

**Clustering Model Implementation:**
Experimented with algorithms such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method and silhouette scores.

**Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**
Analyzed cluster coherence and separability.
Explored cluster characteristics and their business implications.

**Insights and Recommendations:**
Provided actionable insights for business strategies based on cluster profiles.
